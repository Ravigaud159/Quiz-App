# Quiz-App

I've developed a quiz app using Java and Firebase Authentication on the Android Studio platform. This app allows users to easily take quizzes in various categories, including C, C++, HTML, Java, and more. Before starting the quiz, users must register or log in, after which they can choose a quiz from the main activity page. Questions are randomly fetched, and once the quiz is completed, the final score is displayed on the dashboard, along with access to previous scores. After finishing the quiz, users can restart it and take the quiz again. The app also includes a menu bar with options such as logging out, providing feedback, and sharing scores on social media.
